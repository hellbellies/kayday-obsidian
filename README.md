# Obsidian Kayday Plugin

My very opinionated version of a Todo application

## How to use

Create a folder named 'Kayday'.

Any note you add to that folder is considered a task.

Add properties by writing `---` at the top of the file.

The following properties are recognized

-   `context`(text) - e.g. 'home', 'work', 'shopping' ... you will be able to filter by context
-   `priority` (text) - `high`, `medium`, `low`
-   `days` (text) - the days the task should be displayed, e.g. `Mon, Tue, Fri`
-   `hours` (text) - the hours the task should be displayed, e.g. `8, 10` will only display the task between 08:00-08:59 and 10:00-10:59

To show the Kayday Todo List click the leaf icon in the left sidebar.
