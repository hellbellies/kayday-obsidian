# TODO

-   automatically add metadata to new items in the kayday folder (context, tags, repeat, completedOn, etc)
-   display days as badge in upcoming tasks (or maybe just the next upcoming day)
-   sort upcoming tasks (non-day specific first, then sorted by upcoming day from current day)
-   alow hours also to entered as ranges, i.e. not only "1,2,5,6", but also "1-3,12-18,19" (need to decide if 16-17, for instance, includes 17:00-17:59)
-   hide completed tasks by default, let user toggle ... probably best to have the renderTasksGroup() method do it all (including the heading)
-   bug: obsidian's calendar component displays dates as GMT
-   prepare for submission, submit to BRAT
    -   add the minimal stuff needed for official submission (not really needed, I guess)
    -   install the BRAT plugin, submit to BRAT's list
-   add a command to display Kayday
-   let user define what the tasks folder should be called in the Settings
-   visual: use icons to indicated priority instead of text
-   visual: the repeating indicator is too big
