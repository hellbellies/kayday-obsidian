# TODO

-   automatically add metadata to new items in the kayday folder (context, tags, repeat, completedOn, etc)
-   sort completed task by completedOn
-   complete tasks from with KaydayModal
-   display days as badge in upcoming tasks (or maybe just the next upcoming day)
-   sort upcoming tasks (non-day specific first, then sorted by upcoming day from current day)
-   add hours (would be nice to be able to put down ranges ... but then there is a lot 'by convention' involved)
    -   "1,2,5,6"
    -   "1-3,12-18"
